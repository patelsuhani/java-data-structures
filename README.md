## Sorting Algorithms:

* [**Bubble Sort**](bubble-sort/README.md) is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

* [**Merge Sort**](merge-sort/README.md) is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It works by recursively splitting the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element (which is inherently sorted). Then, these subarrays are merged back together in sorted order.

* [**Insertion Sort**](insertion-sort/README.md) is a simple and efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm suitable for small datasets and nearly sorted data. It builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly inserting the next element into the correct position within the sorted portion of the array.
